    "TaskDescription": "Serial feature discrimination. Subjects performed a speeded reaction time task. The target was predicted by preceeding stimuli (A->B+, B-, A->C-, C+), where + corresponds to a 70% probability of seeing the target, and - corresponds to a 30% change of seeing the target. A, B and C are house, faces and body parts, counterbalanced across runs. Unlike in the simultaneous experiment, the A stimulus was presented prior in time to the B or C stimulus at a jittered interval. Scan procedures were identical to the simultaneous experiment and were collected in the same sessions. There are no plans to publish analyses from this study, so experiment details can be found in the linked publication that examines the simultaneous data. If you plan to analyze these data, beware a confound in the design: If you are a subject who has just seen 'A', there is a 50% chance you will see the target on the next stimulus (depending on whether B or C follows). At the end of a trial (after seeing B or C and responding to a target if one appears), there is a 1/3 chance you will see the target on the next stimulus (either A, B-, or C+ will occur). There is therefore a target expectancy difference between times when B and C are preceded by A relative to times that they are not. This difference is born out in faster reaction times for targets preceded by A. fMRI analyses that do not hinge on this comparison be conducted.",
